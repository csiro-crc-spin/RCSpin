   Abstract={The role of screening colonoscopy for colorectal (CR)
                  neoplasia in average-risk population, remains to be
                  determined.\\ To evaluate the prevalence and
                  anatomic location of CR adenoma and carcinoma and
                  the morbidity of colonoscopy in individuals at
                  average risk for CR cancer (CRC).\\ A retrospective
                  prevalence study of subjects aged 40-80 yr, with no
                  cancer-related symptoms, personal or family history
                  of CR neoplasia, who underwent a colonoscopy.\\
                  Enrolled were 1,177 persons; 183 aged 40-49 yr
                  (young), 917 aged 50-75 yr, and 77 aged 76-80 yr
                  (elderly). The prevalence of overall CR neoplasia,
                  advanced neoplasia, and cancer was 20.9\%, 6.3\%, and
                  1.1\%, respectively. In the 50-75 age group, the
                  prevalence of overall adenoma, advanced neoplasia,
                  and cancer was 21.3\%, 6.7\%, and 1.2\%,
                  respectively. Of the 206 neoplasia cases, 21-43\%
                  harbored proximal neoplasia beyond the reach of
                  sigmoidoscopy, without distal lesions. Among the
                  elderly, the prevalence of overall adenoma, advanced
                  neoplasia, and cancer reached 26.0\%, 14.3\%, and
                  2.6\%, respectively. In the young group, 9.8\% had
                  overall neoplasia, 1.1\% had advanced adenoma, and
                  none had CRC. Procedure-related morbidity rate was
                  0.1\%, with no perforations, bleedings, or
                  mortality.\\ Screening colonoscopy in average-risk
                  subjects demonstrated a considerable prevalence of
                  CR neoplasia and proximal lesions beyond the reach
                  of sigmoidoscopy. The morbidity rate was
                  negligible. Primary screening colonoscopy should be
                  considered in health programs for the average-risk
                  population, beginning at the age of 50 yr. The
                  significantly high rate of advanced and proximal
                  neoplasia in the elderly, encourages the inclusion
                  of healthy subjects aged 76-80 yr in future
                  prospective studies.},
