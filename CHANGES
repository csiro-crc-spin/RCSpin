changed 
           treatment_record <- testForAndTreatCRC(person)
            #treatment_record<-NBCSP(person)
how can I optionally turn NBCSP on and off?


Notes 
1) do I need the rep(0,14) when not screening
2) output columns of CRcSpinModel and DulesCrCSpinModel have different names
3) need to set \gamma_1 etc for M and F
